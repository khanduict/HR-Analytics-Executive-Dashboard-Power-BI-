# HR-Analytics Executive Dashboard

## 1. Background
The organization conducted a comprehensive HR analytics review covering the period 2013 to 2019 to gain deeper insight into workforce trends. The dashboards analyze three critical areas:
- Employee Headcount
- Employee Retention
- Employee Turnover
The goal of this analysis is to provide leadership with data-driven insights to support workforce planning, talent management, and strategic decision-making.


## 2. Business Problem Statement
The company lacked a centralized, interactive reporting system to answer key HR questions such as:
- Which departments are growing or shrinking?
- Where is employee turnover highest?
- Which job levels are at the greatest attrition risk?

Without these insights, leadership risked:
- Rising recruitment costs
- Loss of high-performing employees
- Leadership pipeline instability
- Reduced workforce productivity

## 3. Business Objectives
The primary business objectives of this analysis are:
- To monitor workforce size and structure over time.
- To measure employee retention performance and identify improvement opportunities.
